Munchies is a website which aims to find all the nearest restaurant locations that are open and inform the user on what's avalible. The problem with the American Restraunt Industry, at least around Tacoma, Washington, is that alot of places close 8pm, and if you want to find a resteraunt that's open late night, it's impossible to find! Google Maps only shows closed places and it annoys me every time I'm up late at night trying to find somewhere to eat, so I decided to make a website that does that for me! I use Firebase for the database's and auth system, django for my backend algorithms, react and bootstrap for the frontend, and Microsoft Azure for deployment.
